This app accomplishes the following: 

-- Downloads an XML feed from Yahoo Weather for the weather for Sunnyvale, CA.

-- Parses the XML feed, combines feed elements with HTML markup, and displays the resulting HTML in the UI. The results were chosen to be displayed this way for simplicity and speed of development. 

-- Detects when there is a change in the device's connection status and responds accordingly. For example, if the device loses its network connection, the app will not attempt to download the feed.
